#### Abstract 
Building accurate knowledge of the identity, the geographic distribution and the evolution of organisms is essential for biodiversity conservation. Automatic prediction of list of species is useful for many scenarios in biodiversity informatics. In this work, we propose a hybrid model to predict the species that are most probable to be observed at a given location, using environmental features and taxonomy of the organism. These environmental features are represented as k-dimensional image patches, where each dimension represents the value of an environmental  variable,  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  occurrence  of the  species.
The hybrid model Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks henceforth called as CLNN, is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks(LSTMs), where  the  CNN  forms  the  spatial  feature  generator  while  the  LSTM focuses  on  finding  the  taxonomy.  Using  the  dataset  provided  by  GeoLifeCLEF 2018, the proposed method helped achieve a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) score of 0.003 during the test phase.
