### Abstract
Demand forecasting is a prime Revenue Management strategy in any business models of a dynamic nature, especially, in the entertainment industry where inaccurate forecasting leads to errors in pricing, which will negatively impact a multiplex's financial performance in terms of revenue, food and workforce allocation. Challenges in occupancy forecasting involve the direct influence of fluctuations in the film industry, changes in crowd behavior, the indirect influence of the socio-economic events and at times, natural causes. 
In this paper, authors attempt to solve the problem of occupancy forecasting, a very important step in the decision-making process of movie scheduling and management using a booking dataset of a multiplex, consisting of eight screens and an average footfall of about 3500 every day. In order to best capture crowd behavior to predict the occupancy, features were engineered and tuned from historical booking data of the multiplex from 2013 - 2017 followed by employing and testing machine learning models. The authors also discuss approaches related to dataset construction and model validation. The performance of these models was benchmarked using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and was found to be promising and outperformed a field experts predictions.
